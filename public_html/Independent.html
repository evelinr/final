                        recruits Cambridge mathematics alumnus Alan Turing 
                        (Benedict Cumberbatch) to crack Nazi codes, including
                        Enigma -- which cryptanalysts had thought unbreakable

                        analyze Enigma messages while he builds a machine to 
                        decipher them. Turing and team finally succeed and become
                        heroes, but in 1952, the quiet genius encounters disgrace
                        when authorities reveal he is gay and send him to prison.</p>
