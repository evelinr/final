                        recruits Cambridge mathematics alumnus Alan Turing 
                        (Benedict Cumberbatch) to crack Nazi codes, including

                        analyze Enigma messages while he builds a machine to 
                        decipher them. Turing and team finally succeed and become

                    <p>Remnants of a mysterious animal have come to light
                        in a remote jungle, and a group of scientists intends

                        an undiscovered beast.</p><p> To accomplish their goal,

                        Richard Denning, Whit Bissell) must brave the most 
                        perilous pieces of land South America has to offer. 
                        But the terrain is nothing compared to the danger
