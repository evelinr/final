                        It's California 1959 and greaser Danny Zuko and Australian Sandy Olsson are in love.
                        They spend time at the beach, and when they go back to school, what neither of them knows

                        pink-wearing girls led by Rizzo. When they clash at Rydell's first pep rally,
                        Danny isn't the same Danny from the beach.
                        They try to be like each other so they can be together.</p>

                    <p> Diane Court and Lloyd Dobler have just graduated from Lakewood High School in Seattle.
                        Overachieving Diane, who probably does not realize how beautiful 
                        she is, was the class valedictorian. 
                        She strives for excellence in everything she does as a natural course, resulting 
                        in not having a social life, although she could probably get any boy she wanted 
                        despite feeling socially awkward herself.</p>
                        <p> An army brat, Lloyd recently returned to the US to finish high school.
                         Lloyd, who does kick-boxing as a hobby, has no career aspirations, only knowing that he wants to do something great. 
                         His only short term aspiration is to date Diane, despite the improbability, it generally seen that she is out of his league.
